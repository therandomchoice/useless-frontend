# Useless Token frontend

Simple DApp for [Useless tokens](https://github.com/therandomchoice/useless-token).

Any person can mint or burn an arbitrary amount of tokens.
This property of course makes these tokens completely useless from an
economic point of view. That's why they are called Useless.

There is also one peculiarity of transfers. If a person transfers exactly
5 Useless tokens, then this amount is not only transferred to the
recipient, but also remains on the original account. This feature was
added from the fairy tale of the unchangeable dime.

The project only supports Metamask and only works on the Ropsten testnet.
This is a pet project after all.
